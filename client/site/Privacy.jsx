                    By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that adguru will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways. Remember that your use of Services is at all times subject to the Terms as set forth at https://adguru.com/legal/terms, which incorporate this Privacy Policy. Any terms adguru uses in this Privacy Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms.

                <h1>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h1>

                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy covers adguru’ treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Data”) that adguru gathers when you are accessing or using Services. adguru gathers various types of Personal Information from users of adguru, as explained in more detail below, and adguru uses this Personal Information internally in connection with Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve your use of adguru and your experience of Services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use Services. In certain cases, adguru may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As noted in the Terms, adguru does not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 18. If you are under 18, please do not attempt to register for Services or send any Personal Data about yourself to adguru. If adguru shall learn that it has collected Personal Data from a child under age 18, adguru will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 18 may have provided adguru personal information, please contact adguru at legal@adguru.com
                </p>

                <h1>Will adguru ever change this Privacy Policy?</h1>

                <p>
                    adguru is constantly trying to improve Services, so it may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but adguru will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from adguru (or you haven’t provided adguru with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information adguru collects now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.
                </p>

                <h1>What is Personal Information?</h1>
